# Task 1
## What part of the certificate indicates this is a CAâ€™s certificate?
![](task1.1.png)
## What part of the certificate indicates this is a self-signed certificate?
![](task1.2.png)
The Subject Key Identifier and the Authority Key Identifier being the same indicates this certificate is self-signed.
## In the RSA algorithm, we have a public exponent e, a private exponent d, a modulus n, and two secret numbers p and q, such that n = pq. Please identify the values for these elements in your certificate and key files.
